this is the program of calculator by using arithmetic operations
first we use requirements at the top then we use java package  for input like scanner then we declare class name as calculator then uses starting class curly braces then main method because without main method we can not compile or run our program and then uses curly braces of main method then take input of two numbers as a variable who store the value of 2 inputs then we print first statement and in the second statement we use Scannner obj for taking input then performing operation on this value we store  select operation as ch(choice).
then we use if and else if condition for performing this operations .
in the last we enclosed it with curly braces and execute it fot taking output.
for complilation we write in cmd (javac calculator.java)
and for Run time we use (java calculator)
then execute it.
that's it.
