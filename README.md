program 1
this is the program of calculator by using arithmetic operations
first we use requirements at the top then we use java package  for input like scanner then we declare class name as calculator then uses starting class curly braces then main method because without main method we can not compile or run our program and then uses curly braces of main method then take input of two numbers as a variable who store the value of 2 inputs then we print first statement and in the second statement we use Scannner obj for taking input then performing operation on this value we store  select operation as ch(choice).
then we use if and else if condition for performing this operations .
in the last we enclosed it with curly braces and execute it fot taking output.
for complilation we write in cmd (javac calculator.java)
and for Run time we use (java calculator)
then execute it.
that's it.
important thing is that in this program we use the import package..because when we use scanner class its should be needed to mention the import java.util.scanner.



program 2
this is the program of string where we make the data of students. in this data we add there names ,score,average scores from highest or lowest score and also achieved scores.
we take string data type to store the values and names of students
now we convert string datatype to an Array and use .split for making sequence between names and scores.
again we make an array to store the name and score of the students.we use string to store the name of students and int to store scores of the students.
then we start forloop which starts from index 0 to the actual length of the strings and it will work with sign ++increament whenever it will not be stop at false 
position and again we use .split to store the Student records data into the recordsparts.
then we find total number of students by using .length and print it as totalstudents.
then we find the average score of students by using datatype int and making forloop.
in the next statement we use double datatype to find the average score by dividing totalscore/totalstudents and then print average score of all students by using the sign of concatenation.
then we find the students who achieved.
use MIN_VALUE  stored as student highest score and then start the forloop because if the student scores is greater then the highest score then we also provide the name of student with their achieved score.
 the after that use MAX_VALUE  stored as student lowedst score and then start the forloop because if the student scores is lowest then the highest score then we also provide the name of student with their achieved score.
 in the last of this program we use concatenation for every step od student recorded data and print it in one line  by System.out.println.
 thats all
important thing is that in this program we donot use the import package..because when we use scanner class its should be needed to mention the import java.util.scanner.

this program is very very tough for me..but i can do anything and i will give my best ever inshaAllah
